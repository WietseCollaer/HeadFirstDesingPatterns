# Reading Group Head First Design Patterns

This project is a result of the reading group about design patterns. Starting the 6th of june, every week there will be a meetup and a new
design pattern will be added to this repo.

## Strategy Pattern (06/06/2019)
**Strategy Pattern:**
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently
 from clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern (13/06/2019)
**Observer Pattern:**
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Hosted by:** Wietse Collaer

**Next Host:** Maxime Orione

## Decorator Pattern (20/06/2019)
**Decorator Pattern:**
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Hosted by:** Maxime Orione

**Next Host:** Alexandre Vettas

## Factory Pattern (27/06/2019)
**Factory Method Pattern:**
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

**Abstract Factory Pattern:**
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
